task-1 
Create a Python program that can encrypt and decrypt text using the Caesar Cipher algorithm. 
Allow users to input a message and a shift value to perform encryption and decryption.

Description :

i learned from this task are:

This program implements a Caesar cipher for encryption and decryption.

The user can choose to encrypt or decrypt a message by providing a shift value.

The program handles both uppercase and lowercase letters, leaving non-alphabetic characters unchanged.

The Caesar cipher is a simple substitution cipher where each letter in the plaintext is shifted by a fixed number of places down or up the alphabet.

The shift value must be between 1 and 25.

The program prompts the user for input and displays the result accordingly.

The Caesar cipher is named after Julius Caesar, who used it to communicate with his generals.

The encryption and decryption functions use ASCII values to perform the character shifting.

The program is case-sensitive, meaning it treats uppercase and lowercase letters differently.
